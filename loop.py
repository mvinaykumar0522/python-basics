#loop is a programing language that allows us to repeat a set of instructions without writing them again and again 
#interation means one completw exeution of the loop body.in simple wprds.each time the loop runs,it is called one iteration .if loop runs 5 times it means the loop has 5 iterations 
#types:
#for loop:
#       a for loop that repeats a block of code for a specific number of times.it is mostly used when we know how many times we want to repeat somthing.
#       =>it automatically goes through items one by one
# syntax:
#       for variable in sequence:
#               code to be executed  
#  
#while loop
#code block 
#range[start v,end v,]
for i in range(10) :
    print(i)
print("end of the prigram ")
for i in range (16):
    print(i)
for i in range(10,0,-1):
    print(i)
for i in range(1,21,2):
    print(i)
for i in range(101):
    print("square of",i,"is",i*i)
fruits=["apple","mango","banana"]
# to avoid repettion  of code 
# to process collection of data(like going through all numbers in a list,or letters in a string)
#to perform actions a fixed number of times
# the range()function with  for loop :
# most commonly,we use for loop with the range() function 
#syntax of range();
#range(start,stop,step)
#--> start->from where the loop begains(defaullt=0)
#-->stop->loop will stop before this number 
#-->step->difference between numbers(default=1)
#while loop:
